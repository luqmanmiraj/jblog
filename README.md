This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

to install the node modules, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:



## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

```bash
# using npm
npm install


## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npx react-native start --reset-cache

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator correctly.
